  version: 8.0.1
  description: |
    Intermodal Routing is a REST API that offers an innovative and smart routing
    experience in urban areas to navigate between a given pair of locations.
    This is possible when the consolidated public transit offer is intertwined
    with external mobility services dynamically scattered in urban areas.

        Lists intermodal routes.
        All or a combination of the following services may be utilized by the
        intermodal algorithm to generate intermodal routes:

        * Vehicle routing.
        * Intermodal routing with real-time and timetable departures.
        * Pedestrian routing with pedestrian connectivity.
        * Park and Ride service that combines vehicle and public transit routing.
        * Real-time traffic and traffic incidents.
        * Public transit service delays/disruptions information from transit authorities.
        * Amenities available at transit stations or nearby (such as parking, EV charging stations, etc.).
        * Sharing services available at transit stations or nearby (such as car sharing, taxi, bicycle, etc.).

          through cities in the shortest amount of time.
        * `3`: Roads that intersect functional class 2 roads and provide a high volume of traffic
          movement at a lower level of mobility than functional class 2 roads.
        * `4`: Roads that provide for a high volume of traffic movement at moderate speeds between
          neighbourhoods.

            A reference to a routing zone in HMC.

            The standard representation of a routing zone reference has the following structure:
            `{catalogHrn}:{catalogVersion}:({layerId})?:{tileId}:{zoneId}`

            The individual parts are:
            * `catalogHrn`: The HERE Resource Name that identifies the source catalog of the routing zone, example: `hrn:here:data::olp-here:rib-2`
            * `catalogVersion`: The catalog version
            * `layerId` (optional): The layer inside the catalog where the routing zone is located, example: `environmental-zones`
            * `tileId`: The HERE tile key of the partition/tile where the routing zone is located in the given version of the catalog
            * `zoneId`: The identifier of the referenced routing zone within the catalog, example: `here:cm:envzone:3455277`

            Example of a reference to an environmental zone in standard form:
            `hrn:here:data::olp-here:rib-2:1557:environmental-zones:all:here:cm:envzone:3455277`

            In order to reduce reponse size, routing zone references can also be provided in a compact representation.
            In compact form, parts of a reference are replaced by placeholders, which can be resolved using the `refReplacements` dictionary in the parent section.
            The placeholder format is ```\$\d+``` and needs to be surrounded by colons or string start/end. It can be captured with the following regular expression: ```(^|:)\$\d+(:|$)``` .

            Example of the aforementioned environmental zone reference in compact form: `$0:$1:3455277`
            With the corresponding `refReplacements`:
            ```

            {catalogHrn}:{catalogVersion}:({layerId})?:{tileId}:{segmentId}(#{direction}({startOffset}..{endOffset})?)?

            The individual parts are:
            * catalogHrn: The HERE Resource Name that identifies the source catalog of the segment, example: hrn:here:data::olp-here:rib-2
            * catalogVersion: The catalog version
            * layerId (optional): The layer inside the catalog where the segment can be found, example: topology-geometry
            * tileId: The HERE tile key of the partition/tile where the segment is located in the given version of the catalog. This can be on a lower level than the actual segment is stored at (for example, the provided tile ID can be on level 14, despite topology-geometry partitions being tiled at level 12). The level of a HERE tile key is indicated by the position of the highest set bit in binary representation. Since the HERE tile key represents a morton code of the x and y portion of the Tile ID, the level 12 tile ID can be retrieved from the level 14 tile ID by removing the 4 least significant bits (or 2 bits per level) or 1 hexadecimal digit. For example, the level 14 tile 377894441 is included in the level 12 tile 23618402 (377894441<sub>10</sub> = 16863629<sub>16</sub> &rightarrow; 1686362<sub>16</sub> = 23618402<sub>10</sub>)
            * segmentId: The identifier of the referenced topology segment inside the catalog, example: here:cm:segment:84905195
            * direction (optional): Either '*' for undirected or bidirectional, '+' for positive direction, '-' for negative direction, or '?' for unknown direction (not used by the routing service)
            * startOffset/endOffset (optional): The start- and end offset are non-negative numbers between 0 and 1, representing the start and end of the referenced range using a proportion of the length of the segment. 0 represents the start and 1 the end of the segment, relative to the indicated direction (or positive direction in case of undirected segments). Example: 0.7..1

            Example of a segment reference in standard representation:
            hrn:here:data::olp-here:rib-2:1363::377894441:here:cm:segment:84905195#+0.7..1

            The segment references can also be provided in a compact representation, to reduce the response size. In the compact representation, some parts are replaced by placeholders, which can be resolved using the refReplacements dictionary in the parent section.
            The placeholder format is ```\$\d+``` and needs to be surrounded by colons or string start/end. It can be captured with the following regular expression: ```(^|:)\$\d+(:|$)/``` .

            Example of the segment reference previously mentioned in compact representation:
            $0:377894441:$1:84905195#+0.7..1
            With the corresponding refReplacements:

            The id consists of two parts.
            * The direction ('+' or '-')
            * followed by the topology segment id (a unique identifier within the HERE platform catalogs).

            The direction specifies whether the route is using the segment in its canonical direction ('+' aka traveling along the geometry's direction), or against it ('-' aka traveling against the geometry's direction).
          type: string

        segmentRef:
          description: |
            A reference to the HMC topology segment used in this span.

            The standard representation of a segment reference has the following structure:
            {catalogHrn}:{catalogVersion}:({layerId})?:{tileId}:{segmentId}(#{direction}({startOffset}..{endOffset})?)?

            The individual parts are:
            * catalogHrn: The HERE Resource Name that identifies the source catalog of the segment, example: hrn:here:data::olp-here:rib-2
            * catalogVersion: The catalog version
            * layerId (optional): The layer inside the catalog where the segment can be found, example: topology-geometry
            * tileId: The HERE tile key of the partition/tile where the segment is located in the given version of the catalog. This can be on a lower level than the actual segment is stored at (for example, the provided tile ID can be on level 14, despite topology-geometry partitions being tiled at level 12). The level of a HERE tile key is indicated by the position of the highest set bit in binary representation. Since the HERE tile key represents a morton code of the x and y portion of the Tile ID, the level 12 tile ID can be retrieved from the level 14 tile ID by removing the 4 least significant bits (or 2 bits per level) or 1 hexadecimal digit. For example, the level 14 tile 377894441 is included in the level 12 tile 23618402 (377894441<sub>10</sub> = 16863629<sub>16</sub> &rightarrow; 1686362<sub>16</sub> = 23618402<sub>10</sub>)
            * segmentId: The identifier of the referenced topology segment inside the catalog, example: here:cm:segment:84905195
            * direction (optional): Either '*' for undirected or bidirectional, '+' for positive direction, '-' for negative direction, or '?' for unknown direction (not used by the routing service)
            * startOffset/endOffset (optional): The start- and end offset are non-negative numbers between 0 and 1, representing the start and end of the referenced range using a proportion of the length of the segment. 0 represents the start and 1 the end of the segment, relative to the indicated direction (or positive direction in case of undirected segments). Example: 0.7..1

            Example of a segment reference in standard representation:
            hrn:here:data::olp-here:rib-2:1363::377894441:here:cm:segment:84905195#+0.7..1

            The segment references can also be provided in a compact representation, to reduce the response size. In the compact representation, some parts are replaced by placeholders, which can be resolved using the refReplacements dictionary in the parent section.
            The placeholder format is ```\$\d+``` and needs to be surrounded by colons or string start/end. It can be captured with the following regular expression: ```(^|:)\$\d+(:|$)/``` .

            Example of the segment reference previously mentioned in compact representation:
            $0:377894441:$1:84905195#+0.7..1
            With the corresponding refReplacements:
            "refReplacements": {
              "0": "hrn:here:data::olp-here:rib-2:1363:",
